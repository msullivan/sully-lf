This is a fairly simple standalone implementation of the Edinburgh
Logical Framework, adapted from my Typecoin work (but with the few
Typecoin extensions to LF stripped out). It could be useful
educationally (or maybe even practically if you need to embed LF in
your stuff for some reason but don't need to parse it >_>).

It is all pretty atrociously documented, though, and not that great of
code to begin with.

Some notes on the implementation:
 * We use the Canonical LF methodology in which all expressions must
   be in "Canonical Form": beta-short and eta-long.
   That is, there are no beta redexes (no lambdas applied to
   arguments) and everything is maximally eta-extended (every variable
   and constant of function type is applied to all of its arguments).
 * The type-checking rules for LF involve substitution and
   substitution does not preserve canonical forms in general. To
   handle this we use "hereditary substitution" which automatically
   reduces any new beta-redexes that would be introduced by a
   substitution.
 * Hereditary substitution is defined such that it always terminates,
   even for ill-typed terms. (Though on ill-typed terms it may return
   an error.)
 * The lack of beta redexes is enforced by representing applications in
   spine form: all applications are syntactically a head (a variable
   or constant) applied to a spine (list) of expressions.
 * One of the big advantages of Canonical LF is that term/type
   equality is just structural equality!
 * To make this extra true, we represent variables using de Bruijn
   indexes.
 * Code is also included that can convert Vanilla LF to Canonical LF.
   Vanilla LF is encoded using the same syntax tree as Canonical LF,
   through the presence of a head constructor that takes an
   (expression : type) pair. The typechecker rejects terms using this
   constructor.
   The canonicalization process first does a type-directed eta-expansion
   pass (but where the type-directedness totally ignores all dependent
   features, and simply distinguishes between functions and base types).
   I think that the eta-expansion pass also serves as type-checking
   for the STLC-only version.

   Then a beta-normalization pass is done that uses hereditary substitution
   to substitute away any beta redexes.
